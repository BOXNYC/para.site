# para.site
para.site is a automatic website builder that uses social media API to generate. If you have a public Facebook page, Instagram account, Google Place, or Bandcamp account, you already have a para.site website.

Currently para.site latches on to Facebook, Instagram, Google Places, and Bandcamp APIs, but in the future, we may add Pinterest and LinkedIn. Currently we don't have plans to connect to Google Plus, mainly because we think Google Places has more usage because of Google Maps.

## Free Usage Documentation
Free usage of the para.site system is access to sub-domain websites and requires manual refreshing of the cached site otherwise cache TTL is one month. The sub-domain naming convention goes like so:

`SN_UID`.`SN`.para.site/`PG`/`PA`



`SN_UID` : Social Network User ID
`SN` : Social Network (Default 'fb')
`PG` : Page
`PA` : Page Argument
